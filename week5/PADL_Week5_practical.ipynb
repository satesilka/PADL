We put our logistic regression model in a superclass of `torch.nn.Module`. The model itself consists of a linear layer mapping 9 input features to 1 output. This is then passed through a sigmoid layer so that the model outputs probability of one of the two classes. Since we are doing binary cross entropy loss, we use `torch.nn.BCELoss` as our loss function (note: the sigmoid is applied inside the model so we don't use the version of the loss function that combines sigmoid and BCE - but this would be a perfectly valid alternative). We train as normal and evaluate on the test set. But this time, we threshold the output probabilities to make our final hard class decisions and compute the percent correct.\n",

This MLP should have one hidden layer with 16 nodes and ReLU activation, then an output layer with sigmoid activation (to output the class probability). To do this, replace the logisticRegression class with an MLP model that includes the additional layers (note: this is only a small modification of the logistic regression model).\n",

Experiment with using different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer. What happens to performance and generalisation? Keep in mind how many parameters your model has and how many training samples you have. Try adding a second hidden layer and again, experiment with the effect on performance.\n",
