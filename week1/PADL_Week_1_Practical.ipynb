Since you want to directly minimise the function itself, you don't need any additional loss function. Instead, you can simply optimise the value of this function directly using the same strategy you used to minimise a loss function in the previous exercises. What values did you find for the minimum? Do you get different results with different initialisations?\n"],"id":"nJD2-P8a9mVR"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def smooth_2d_function(x, y):\n","    z = -(\n","        torch.exp(-(x - 2) ** 2 - (y - 2) ** 2) +\n","        2 * torch.exp(-(x + 2) ** 2 - (y + 2) ** 2)\n","    )\n","    return z\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9uhDWH_-paT5"},"id":"9uhDWH_-paT5","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["x = torch.tensor(-1.0, requires_grad=True)\n","y = torch.tensor(-1.0, requires_grad=True)\n","\n","optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([x, y], lr=0.1)\n","\n","n_iter = 100\n","for step in range(n_iter):\n","    optimizer.zero_grad()\n","    loss = smooth_2d_function(x, y)\n","    loss.backward()\n","    optimizer.step()\n","\n","    if not step % 5:\n","        print(f\"Step {step}: x = {x.item():.4f}, y = {y.item():.4f}, loss = {loss.item():.6f}\")\n","\n","print(f\"Minimum found at: x = {x.item():.4f}, y = {y.item():.4f}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IWAaqugspuyq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739271836984,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":159,"user":{"displayName":"Anna Hrynyshyn","userId":"11970729323986621431"}},"outputId":"8a720c14-4c26-4c94-c7e2-dedc23a45a25"},"id":"IWAaqugspuyq","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Step 0: x = -1.0541, y = -1.0541, loss = -0.270671\n","Step 5: x = -1.4963, y = -1.4963, loss = -0.929885\n","Step 10: x = -1.9333, y = -1.9333, loss = -1.952712\n","Step 15: x = -1.9948, y = -1.9948, loss = -1.999696\n","Step 20: x = -1.9996, y = -1.9996, loss = -1.999998\n","Step 25: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 30: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 35: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 40: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 45: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 50: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 55: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 60: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 65: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 70: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 75: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 80: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 85: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 90: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Step 95: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000, loss = -2.000000\n","Minimum found at: x = -2.0000, y = -2.0000\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!mv /content/drive/MyDrive/PADL_Week_1_Practical.ipynb week1/\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tXGPf7sm_Qrj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739461563901,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":230,"user":{"displayName":"Anna Hrynyshyn","userId":"11970729323986621431"}},"outputId":"73bbba9c-59f8-4002-ffed-8ecba15dfddf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"id":"tXGPf7sm_Qrj","execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["mv: cannot stat '/content/drive/MyDrive/PADL_Week_1_Practical.ipynb': No such file or directory\n"]}]}]}
